# Pulse Technology — Sales & Customer Analytics (2019–2022)

End-to-end **SQL and Tableau business intelligence analysis** evaluating revenue trends, customer behavior, product performance, refunds, and regional growth for a consumer electronics company navigating COVID-era demand shifts.

---

## Business Objective

Leadership requested a **data-driven performance review** to support preparation for a 2023 company-wide town hall, focusing on:

- Revenue trends before, during, and after COVID  
- Key growth drivers across products and regions  
- Loyalty program performance and retention behavior  
- Refund risk and customer value indicators  

---

## Tools & Methods

- **SQL:** data cleaning, joins, aggregations, KPI analysis  
- **Tableau:** executive dashboard design and visualization  
- **Data Modeling:** relational schema with ERD validation  
- **Business Analysis:** revenue trends, AOV, loyalty impact, refund risk  

---

## Executive Summary

**Key Takeaways**

- Revenue surged during COVID (peaking Q4 2020) and stabilized at a **higher post-COVID baseline**, indicating durable demand rather than temporary lift.  
- Revenue is concentrated in a **small number of top-performing products**, creating both growth leverage and concentration risk.  
- **Loyalty customers provide more stable repeat revenue**, reinforcing retention-focused strategy over short-term AOV gains.

## Data Structure

Relational dataset composed of four core tables:

- `orders` — transactional purchases  
- `customers` — attributes and loyalty status  
- `order_status` — fulfillment and refund lifecycle  
- `geo_lookup` — country-to-region mapping  

An ERD illustrating table relationships is included below.

## Data Cleaning & Assumptions

Data quality issues were reviewed prior to analysis.  
Only **low-risk, clearly resolvable issues** were corrected.

**Actions included:**

- Standardizing inconsistent product names  
- Normalizing date formats  
- Replacing blank marketing channels with “Unknown”  
- Correcting region values using country codes  

Records lacking reliable source validation (e.g., zero prices, missing currency, anomalous timestamps) were **retained** due to minimal aggregate impact.
