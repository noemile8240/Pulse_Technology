\f0 \cf0 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 \outl0\strokewidth0 - **Diversify revenue drivers by expanding mid-tier product offerings**  \
  Reducing reliance on a small group of top-performing products can improve revenue resilience, margin stability, and long-term growth balance.\
- **Introduce targeted product bundling to bridge volume and value dynamics** \
  Pairing high-volume accessories with premium products through bundled offers or incentive pricing can increase average order value, cross-category attachment, and overall revenue efficiency.\
\
- **Continue investing in the loyalty program with a retention-first strategy**  \
  Prioritize customer lifecycle value and revenue stability rather than short-term AOV expansion to strengthen sustainable performance.\
\
- **Reduce high-value refund exposure in premium product categories**  \
  Focus on quality control, return-prevention initiatives, and post-purchase support for premium laptops where per-order refund risk is highest.\
\
- **Balance core-market growth in North America with international expansion**  \
  Strengthening product depth, promotions, and engagement in North America can drive near-term revenue gains given its ~52% share, while continued investment in EMEA and APAC reduces concentration risk and enables scalable long-term growth.\
